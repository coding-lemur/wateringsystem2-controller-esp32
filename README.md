# wateringsystem controller 2.0 with ESP32

## Description

This controller is the heart of my new wateringsystem.

## Features

- Monitoring weather data (temperature, humidity and air pressure)
- Monitoring th soil moisture of the plant
- Monitoring of energy consumption
- super long deepsleep times to save energy
- easy to configurable with the help of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)
- Controllable via MQTT
- widely-used sensors
- completly asynchron programming
- host by your own: complete control over your data (no external cloud service needed)
- OTA updates

## Setup

- connect all parts to the ESP32
- connect power
- the ESP32 starting an own Wifi access point named "wateringsystem-{device ID}"
- connect to this Wifi with your smartphone
- use `waaatering` for Wifi password
- you will redirected to a config page
- insert your Wifi and MQTT broker credentials
- click on "save"
- the ESP32 will restarting and connect to your MQTT broker
- after about 1 minute you should see a new topic in your MQTT broker `wateringsystem/{device ID}/out/info` with a lot of information in the payload

## MQTT API

The whole module is controllable via MQTT protocol. So it's easy to integrate in existing SmartHome systems (like Home Assistant or Node-Red).
